Minos is a simple and retro styled Hexo theme which concentrates more on your ideas. Minos is very expressive as it has extensive plugin support, colorful code highlighting choices, flexible configurations and out-of-box multi-language support. Meanwhile, minimalism also makes Minos a great theme for both writers and readers who desire a better reading experience.

To get started with Minos, download and unzip Minos to your Hexo blog's theme directory or using the following command in your blog's root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-minos.git themes/minos
```

You can also specify a version for Minos after downloading the theme through `git`. Replace the version code in the following command and execute:

```bash
git checkout 1.0.0
```

You can also install Minos as a git submodule by calling the following command:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-minos.git themes/minos
```

Next, replace the theme setting in your blog's `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
theme: minos
```

Then, edit `_config.yml.example` file in the `themes/minos` folder to your satisfaction and save it as `_config.yml` in the same directory.
